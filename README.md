Broadcast messages to people who don't have you on their contact list in Whatsapp

This code will pull Full Names from an Excel Spreadsheet, get the First Names (first words of each item) and allow you to create a personalised message to be sent in Web Whatsapp.  

This is particularly better than a Broadcast message inside Whatsapp as the Broadcast would only send messages to recipients that also have you in their contact list.  

The current message template is "Hi {name}, multi-line message".  

But this can be easily changed.  

If you find a particular full name to be having trouble locating the specific person you are looking for, you can always type their full number. 

You can also test results of specific numbers or names on web whatsapp search box manually beforehand.  

I hope this can be helpful to you.
